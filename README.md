HW03:  
&nbsp      Section 01 - Importance of Phase vs Magnitude of an image fourier transform.  
      Section 02 - Aligning FMRI pictures using correlation and gradient ascent.  
      Section 03 - Finding dialed numbers from dialer sounds (beeps) in a noisy place.  
</br>
ProjectPhase1_FFT:  
      Simply deleting imaginary noise from a signal and showing that the magnitude is even and phase is odd.  
ProjectPhase1_Sampling:  
      Finding more about sampling basics. The written function SemiBandFFT() could be useful to find DFT of sampled continuous-time signals.  
ProjectPhase1_EEG:  
      Preprocessings of EEG signals. including filtering, down sampling and epoching.  
ProjectPhase1_Clustering:  
      Clustering of EEG channel signals based on correlation.
